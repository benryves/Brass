.db/.byte/.text/.dw/.word
.db expression [, expression [, expression [, ...]]]
Defines bytes (.db, .byte, .text) or words (.dw, .word).
You can specify a comma-delimited list of expressions. Unlike most places expressions are used, you can include strings. Here are a few examples:
====
.db 1, 2, 3, 4
.dw $CAFE, $BABE
.db "This is a string", '!', $20, "Here's a \"capital\" E: ", 'e'+('A'-'a'), 0
====
----
If you are defining strings, .asc is a better option is it allows you to specify the ASCII mapping in use.
