        <pre class="code">.for <i>label, start, end, [step]</i></pre>
        <p>This directive is used to assemble a block of code multiple times. For example; unrolling loops or defining blocks of data programmatically.</p>
        <p>A label is created and set to the value of <i>start</i>. The code is assembled between the <tt class="code">.for</tt> directive and the matching <tt class="code">.loop</tt>, and the value of the label is adjusted by <i>step</i> at the end of each loop. If it goes beyond the value of <i>end</i>, the label is freed and the assembler carries on.</p>
