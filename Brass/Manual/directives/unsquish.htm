        <p>Unsquishes any following bytes when output. An "unsquished" byte takes up two bytes when output, and is made up of the two ASCII characters that represent it as a hexadecimal value - so, for example, $3F when unsquished will be output as '3', 'F'. Note that even though the output data is twice as big, addressing is still calculated on a single byte basis. Designed for use with the TI-8X series calculators (an unsquished program can be edited, compiled or run as machine code on the calculator). Unsquished programs on the TI-8X still require regular 'squished' data (<tt>:AsmPrgm</tt> or <tt>:End:0000:End</tt> token sequences), hence this is a switchable option rather than an output mode.</p>
