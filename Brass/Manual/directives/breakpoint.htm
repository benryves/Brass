        <p>Adds a breakpoint to the current line. This does not directly have any effect on the output binary, but can affect some of the output debugging information (for example, breakpoints can be added to Emukon's debugger via patch files). The description field is a text string (optionally enclosed in <tt>"</tt>speech marks<tt>"</tt>) which is exported along with the breakpoint information.</p>
