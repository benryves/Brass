<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Large opcode support, including every documented Z80 instruction (and most undocumented ones).</p>
<p>Nested module code structure to break code up neatly.</p>
<p>Basic string-replacement macro preprocessor.</p>
<p>XML output of debug file and error log for emulators or IDEs to parse.</p>
<p>Extensive variables system allowing for variables to be 'typed' (as a debugger hint), including arrays and structs. Variables are shuffled around to fit in user-defined safe RAM areas, and temporary variables (that can be overwritten by other temporary variables in unrelated modules) can be defined.</p>
<p>Native output of raw binary, Intel (word), MOS technology and Motorola hexadecimal, TI-73/82/83/83+/85/86, and Sega Master System/Game Gear (including official ROM header and SDSC tag) files.</p>
<p>Simple multi-page application support.</p>
