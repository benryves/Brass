        <h3>Variables in Label Names</h3>
        <p>In some instances, you'll need to give labels names that include a value to keep them individual - for example, when defining a for-loop. Surround the expression in curly braces in the label name - for example:</p>
        <pre class="code">num = 3

_label_{num}:
    jr _label_3     ; Jump to the label above
    jr _label_{num} ; Same thing</pre>
